1. We have 4 different scan types discussed in the OSCP book using Nessus Essentials. They are Basic Network scan, Advanced Scan, Advanced Dynamic Scan and Credentialed Patch Audit.
2. We can also use Nmap for lightweight vulnerability scanning.
	1. `sudo nmap -sV -p 443 --script "vuln" ipaddress`: This is one command
	2. We can also find an nse script online then do `sudo cp /path/to/file_script.nse /usr/share/nmap/scripts/file_script.nse`
	3. Then we run `sudo nmap --script-updatedb`
	4. Finally `sudo nmap -sV -p 443 --script "file_script" ipaddress`
