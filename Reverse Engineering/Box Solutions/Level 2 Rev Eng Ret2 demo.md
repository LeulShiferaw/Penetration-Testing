- Steps for solving this box are straight forward
- We put a break point at cmp dl, al
- Then we check when it goes into the wrong direction
- We see the character at dl and al
- We will input the al and see the resulting value for dl at that position (kth character)
- Then when we input that resulting value it will pass for that character
- We repeat for the next character until it passes the whole code
- It is better to use the python script to automate the process
## Side Note
- It goes character by character and converts our input into something. 
- It is reversible so if we put in a character we can get it back by putting back the result of putting the character
