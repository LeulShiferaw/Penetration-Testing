1. The principle of least privilege: each part with a system should only have the bare minimum security access to do its job.
2. The Zero Trust: principle of least privilege on steroids. We don't trust anyone and give them granular permissions to do their job.
3. Open Security: we shouldn't rely on secrecy of the system to be more secure. Even if the attacker knows that the cryptographic algorithm, it shouldn't allow them to hack into the system.
4. Defense in Depth: we should have multiple layers of security.
