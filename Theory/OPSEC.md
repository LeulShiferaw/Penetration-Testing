- Coined by the US military it is a process by which potential adversaries can be denied information about capabilities and intentions by identifying, controlling, and protecting generally unclassified evidence of the planning and execution of sensitive activities
- Steps:
	1. Identify critical information: red team's intentions, capabilities, activities, and limitations
	2. Threat analysis: identifying potential adversaries and their intentions and capabilities
	3. Vulnerability Analysis: when an adversary can obtain critical information, analyse the findings, and act in a way that would affect your plans.
	4. Risk assessment: requires learning the possibility of an event taking place along with the expected cost of that event
	5. Countermeasures: designed to prevent an adversary from detecting critical information, provide an alternative interpretation of critical information or indicators (deception) or deny the adversary's collection system.
- All these steps are from the point of view of the attacker. So the risk assessment could be whether we will be detected by IPS/IDS/SIEM. We are not talking about the risk from the target's perspective.
- We are trying to hide the tools, infrastructure and intent of the red team
