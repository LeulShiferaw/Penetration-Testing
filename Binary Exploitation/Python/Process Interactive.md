eg:
```python
import interact

process = interact.Process()

print(process.readuntil('name?'))

process.sendline('Bob')
print(process.readuntil('Hello Bob'))

print(process.readuntil("problem:"))
val1 = (int(process.readuntil(' ')))
process.readuntil(' ')
val2 = (int(process.readuntil(' ')))
print(val1 + val2)
process.interactive()

```

- The above line of code interacts with python. It reads and write to and from it.
- The program reads until the question ending with "name?"
- Then it send any name
- Then reads the response, upto the input that ends with "problem:"
- Then it reads two ints that are created by the program
- We sum them up and print it back
- It automates the task of getting two random numbers to sum up
