- CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) vs RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)

- CISC runs more complex instructions with one Fetch-Decode-Execute-Store instructions

- RISC breaks it down and runs each in its own Fetch-Decode-Execute-Store instructions

- RISC is becoming more prevalent as it consumes power because each instructions takes one clock cycle

- RISC has about 200 instruction while CISC has about 1500

- RISC is used for ARM and Apple and mobile devices

- CISC is used for Intel and AMD
